<b><i>Project is still in development</b></i>

In this project I want to analyse and understand price of flats in Poznan(Poland). 
Project has two parts:
- first one: full based on python and webscrapping OtoDom.pl and collect data
- second one: using collected data to analyse and visualisation in Jupyter.

At this moment I'm working on second part of project.
